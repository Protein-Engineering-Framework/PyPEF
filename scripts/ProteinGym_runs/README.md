## Benchmark runs on publicly available ProteinGym protein variant sequence-fitness datasets

Data is taken (script-based download) from "DMS Assays"-->"Substitutions" and "Multiple Sequence Alignments"-->"DMS Assays" data from https://proteingym.org/download.
First, run `download_proteingym_and_extract_data.py` to download and extract the ProteinGym data and subsequently run `run_performance_tests_proteingym_data.py` to get the predictions/the performance on those datasets.
