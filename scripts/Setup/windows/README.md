Double clicking the Batch (BAT) file Installs Miniconda3 locally in working/download directory, adds a Python 3.10 environment, and installs the latest PyPEF version for that environment (requires the two PowerShell (PS1) scripts in the same directory as the BAT script).
Note that invoking the PS scripts requires setting the PowerShell [execution policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.3) with Administrator rights to Bypass  
(`powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File`) for running the Batch file successfully.
